Question: - 
If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No, Java does not allow you to create two constructor methods that only differ by the names of their parameters 
(e.g., one for title and another for category) because constructor overloading in Java requires that
 each overloaded constructor must have a unique parameter list . The parameter list is distinguished by:

The number of parameters , or
The types of parameters , or
The order of parameter types .
